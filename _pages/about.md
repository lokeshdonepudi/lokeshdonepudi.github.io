Hi, I’m Lokesh. I’m a second-year Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, originally from Northern Virginia. I’m interested in designing and building technology that blends hardware and software, and I’m currently strengthening my foundation in programming, circuits, and core engineering concepts through my coursework and projects.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing golf and poker in my free time, and I like hanging out with friends whenever I get the chance. These activities help me stay balanced and sharpen skills like focus, strategy, and decision-making. I’m motivated by learning new things, taking on challenges, and continuously improving both technically and personally as I work toward a career in engineering.
